Basic 4S1P Sodium-ion Battery Solar System

This is a project to design an off-grid solar system using a 4 series 1 parallel SiB (Sodium-Ion Battery) battery and a small array of solar panels to create a self-suffcient lighting fixture.
This project was started in April 2024 and makes use of 18650 cells from Hakadi battery. The battery spec is included in the datasheets folder. 

The BMS unit is also from Hakadi and is supposedly built to be for sodium cells. It is the 4S, 12V, 20A variety.

The solar cells used are from "SUNYIMA" and are 5V, 60mA rated cells. Very low cost purchased from amazon. 

The charge controller is from "Renogy" and was also purchased on amazon, another low cost option. It has 12V and 24V capabilites and a maximum of 10A current rating. It is a PWM solar charge controller.

The solar panels will be connected in a 3S3P configuration. This should provide a max voltage of 15V and max current of 180mA. The cells are rated for 1500mAh so at max current with perfect efficiency it would take 8 hours to charge this battery pack.

There may be the possibility of building a 1S10P configuration with all 10 solar panels to create 600mA of current and charge a single cell at a time. Progress and documentation will follow
